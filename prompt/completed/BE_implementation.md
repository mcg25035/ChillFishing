# Backend Implementation Status

This document outlines the completion of the backend implementation for the 悠閒釣魚抽獎 Website, as per the requirements in `prompt/GLOBAL.prompt.md` and `prompt/BE.prompt.md`.

## Completed Tasks:

1.  **Project Setup and Dependencies**:
    *   Updated `BE/package.json` to include necessary dependencies: `express`, `socket.io`, `sqlite3`, `dotenv`, `uuid`.
    *   Executed `npm install` within the `BE` directory to install these dependencies.

2.  **Database Module (`BE/db.js`)**:
    *   Created `BE/db.js` to manage SQLite database connection and initialization.
    *   Implemented schema creation for `prizes`, `consolation_messages`, `settings`, `tokens`, and `raffle_logs` tables.
    *   Ensured `DATABASE_PATH` is hardcoded to `./data/raffle.db` as per user feedback.
    *   Added graceful database closing on process termination.

3.  **Authentication Middleware (`BE/middleware/auth.js`)**:
    *   Created `BE/middleware/auth.js` to authenticate admin requests using `SECRET_IDENTIFY_TEXT` from the `settings` table.

4.  **Token Generator Utility (`BE/utils/tokenGenerator.js`)**:
    *   Created `BE/utils/tokenGenerator.js` to provide a function for generating unique UUID-based tokens.

5.  **Raffle Service Logic (`BE/services/raffleService.js`)**:
    *   Created `BE/services/raffleService.js` to encapsulate the core raffle logic.
    *   Manages a global `isRaffleLocked` state to control raffle draws.
    *   Implements `performRaffle` to determine prize winners based on probabilities and remaining quantities, or return a consolation message.
    *   Handles decrementing prize quantities and logging raffle results.

6.  **Admin API Routes (`BE/routes/admin.js`)**:
    *   Created `BE/routes/admin.js` to define all administrator-specific API endpoints under `/api/admin`.
    *   Implemented endpoints for:
        *   Admin login (`/login`)
        *   Prize management (CRUD: `GET /prizes`, `POST /prizes`, `DELETE /prizes/:id`)
        *   Consolation message management (CRUD: `GET /consolation-messages`, `POST /consolation-messages`, `DELETE /consolation-messages/:id`)
        *   Activity setting (`POST /settings/public` to toggle public/private activity).
        *   Token generation (`POST /tokens/generate`).
        *   Viewing generated tokens (`GET /tokens`).
    *   All admin routes are protected by the `authenticateAdmin` middleware.

7.  **Participant API Routes (`BE/routes/participant.js`)**:
    *   Created `BE/routes/participant.js` to define participant-specific API endpoints under `/api/participant`.
    *   Implemented endpoints for:
        *   Activity entry (`POST /enter`) with token validation for private activities.
        *   Raffle draw (`POST /raffle`) which integrates with `raffleService` and handles token usage for private activities.
    *   Includes a mechanism to inject the Socket.IO instance.

8.  **Main Server File (`BE/server.js`)**:
    *   Rewrote `BE/server.js` to set up the Express server and integrate all created modules.
    *   Initialized Socket.IO and configured CORS.
    *   Loaded environment variables using `dotenv`.
    *   Ensured `SECRET_IDENTIFY_TEXT` is loaded and used to initialize the database setting.
    *   Handled Socket.IO `connection` and `nextRaffle` events for real-time communication and raffle state unlocking.

9.  **Environment Configuration (`.env`)**:
    *   Created `.env` file in the project root (`/home/codingbear/Code/ChillFishing`) with `PORT` and `SECRET_IDENTIFY_TEXT`.
    *   Removed `DATABASE_PATH` from `.env` as per user's request, making it a fixed path within the backend.

## Next Steps for User:

*   **Update `SECRET_IDENTIFY_TEXT`**: Change `your_secret_admin_key` in the `.env` file to a strong, secure secret.
*   **Start Backend Server**: Navigate to the `BE` directory and run `node server.js`.
*   **Frontend Implementation**: Proceed with the frontend implementation based on `prompt/FE.prompt.md`.
